    "- How to use virtual environments\n",

    "### 1. Before we begin I: Using Python virtual environments in VS Code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem which you may (have) run into when using any programming language, but Python in particular, is that you end up with the wrong versions of packages. This is because new (versions of) Python and its packages are released all the time, and they all rely on a bunch of other packages which also update all the time. As a result, installing the latest version of each package sometimes results in things not working as expected, but then\n",
    "downgrading some of those requires that you also downgrade others, et cetera, et cetera, until you get stuck in what we call package dependency hell. Luckily, programmers did what they do best and programmed a solution to this problem... as yet another package, called venv. This package allows us to set up ‘virtual environments’, which consist of a specified set of packages with specific versions, linked to one specific project you have. This can be\n",
    "very convenient if you need a particular combination of packages, but you don’t want to mess with the packages installed on the rest of your system (which could potentially break your other projects). Additionally, for a scientific workflow, it can be very nice to have the version numbers of your packages be neatly documented and static throughout the course of your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you install packages into your global environment, in time it will become crowded with potentially unrelated or unexpected packages and make it difficult to properly test an application. You typically want to create an environment for each workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use VSCode, when you open a folder in a location that has a virtual environment, it will automatically activate it for you. If there is no virtual environment yet, you can create\n",
    "one from the terminal (in the current working directory) by running the following command (if on Mac, you will need to use python3 instead of python in your commands): \n",
    "\n",
    "`python -m venv .venv`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not like the command window and prefer to do things in VS Code: another way to do this is using the menu, by opening the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), start typing `Python: Create Environment` to search, and then select the command. The command presents a list of environment types: Venv or Conda. We will choose `venv` (only do this if you did not run the command above in the terminal)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After this is done, **terminate your existing terminals** (using the bin icon to the right,\n",
    "not using the cross – that will just hide it). Create a new file inside your project directory,\n",
    "e.g. test.py, and open it. This will prompt VSCode to start looking for a version of\n",
    "Python to run this script with, and in the bottom right corner it should eventually show\n",
    "you something like 3.9.x ('.venv': venv) – this means it has found your newly created\n",

    "which you would use Python or pip normally – except that all actions will use the version\n",
    "of Python and its packages inside your virtual environment. To install a package to your\n",
    "virtual environment, for instance numpy, just use:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install numpy` \n",

    "##### 3.1 What is an image?\n",
    "An image, digital image, or still image is a binary representation of visual information, such as drawings, pictures, graphs, logos, or individual video frames. An image is composed of picture elements, also known as pixels, each with a value for its intensity or gray-level. \n",
    "\n",

    "- Bitmap images (.jpeg, .gif, ,.png)\n",
    "- Vector images (.svg, .eps, .ai)\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we will focus on Bitmap images. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.2 Bitmap images\n",
    "Bitmap images (also known as raster images) are made up of pixels in a grid. Pixels are picture elements; tiny dots of individual colour that make up what you see on your screen. Pixels are defined by 2 properties: their *position* on the picture/grid and their *colour value*. These properties are stored in a bitmap file for every single pixel in the picture. This means that images are actually arrays (do you remember arrays?) of binary numbers. The more bits (the longer the binary number), the more colours that can be encoded.\n",

    "If you are doing your image processing with Python, there are various libraries you could use. Some popular ones are OpenCV, scikit-image, Python Imaging Library and Pillow. We won't discuss which image processing library is the best here; they all have their merits. This module will focus on Pillow, a powerful library that provides a wide array of image processing features and is simple to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL). PIL is a library that offers several standard procedures for manipulating images. It's a powerful library but hasn't been updated since 2009 and doesn't support Python 3. Pillow builds on this, adding more features and support for Python 3. It supports a range of image file formats such as PNG, JPEG, PPM, GIF, TIFF, and BMP. We'll see how to perform various operations on images such as cropping, resizing, adding text to images, rotating, greyscaling, etc., using this library.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3.4 Locating the images \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can work with and edit images, the system needs to know where we've stored them. If you have correctly forked and cloned this week's repository, you should have a folder with images located in your repository. You can use those images for the exercises. However, if you want to play around with your own images, feel free to use those!  "
